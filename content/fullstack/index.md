# Foundations

## SOLID

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Clean Code

- DRY
- KISS

## Two Things
