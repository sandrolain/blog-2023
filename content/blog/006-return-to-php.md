A longtime friend a few days ago proposed to me a project for a portal dedicated to merchants.
Currently, he develops in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and therefore among the requirements is the use of this language.

I have been a PHP programmer for several years when developing websites and web portals as well as API backends for native applications.
Since I changed jobs two years ago I have not had the opportunity to use the language.
Over the years I have developed several libraries, frameworks as well as CMS that I kept for myself and that facilitated the development of websites, with a philosophy that I would say quite opinionated (for example, I have never used [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)).

In the last few days, I got back to PHP development by trying *composer* and looking for some simple but effective libraries that would allow me to reach the goal without the burden of having to learn to use very complex frameworks like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) for a project that must be with a low effort.

Finding the libraries wasn't difficult, here are my choices:

- Env Vars: [PHPdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)
- Routing: [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute)
- MySQL Client: [MeekroDB](https://meekro.com/)
- Template: [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/)
- Unit Test: [PHPunit](https://phpunit.de/)

At the moment I am still experimenting with new approaches to PHP derived from the experience of backend development with nodejs and with golang.

A little at a time I am creating a small framework (opinionated :D) that may be in the future I will share with you, for now it is just an exercise.
However, it will be a very light thing,

***"My Little Framework"***.
