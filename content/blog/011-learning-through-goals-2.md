It's been a while since my last post because in the meantime I moved home and I still have many boxes to empty. :D

By continuing to work side by side with PHP 8 and GoLang I was able to compare different approaches to backend development.

Although PHP has made great strides with versions 7 and 8 it still lags behind in terms of typing robustness, and Composer naturally suffers from conflicts between different versions of the same libraries, so with large applications and with many dependencies you risk running into the problem.

GoLang in the latest versions has partially solved the dependency problem but its module management system works best only if you follow precise patterns.

As the market requires more and more GoLang developers I decided to focus on the new language to learn more about libraries and patterns, and to do that I am converting the parts written in PHP 8 to GO.
To fully modernize the approach I also decided to switch from MySQL to MongoDB.

Let's see if I will be able to complete the mission. ðŸš€
