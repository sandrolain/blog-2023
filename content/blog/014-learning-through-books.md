After a period spent honing my GOlang knowledge through the practical application I decided to return to the classic study on books.

There are a number of books that I would like to read, in particular to orient myself on learning the more theoretical and architectural side of programming, as well as on teamwork.

Books that I have already read or that I would like to read are collected in my [notes on github](https://github.com/sandrolain/notes/blob/main/notes/Books.md).
