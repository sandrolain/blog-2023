I have been following the world of micro-frontends for some time, partly because it is the latest fashion, partly because it is the expression of the micro-services brought to the frontend.

Starting from the book ["Micro Frontends in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/micro-frontends-in-action) by Michael Geers published by Mannings,
and awaiting the publication of the book ["Building Micro-Frontends"](https://www.buildingmicrofrontends.com/) by Luca Mezzalira published by Oâ€™Reilly,
in the meantime I encountered a series of articles and collected here for you.
